See: Atmel Application Note AVR068 - STK500 Communication Protocol

Atmel AVR programmers can use a standardized, open protocol for communication
between the programmer software and the hardware device. Many software programmers,
including *avrdude*, support the STK500 protocol. Therefore, building a new
hardware programmer with support for STK500 ensures it will be broadly
compatible with existing software.

Principle
---------

A series of FSMs will be used to implement the STK500 protocol in an FPGA.
